= What do I need? ==
== Java Runtime Environment ==
If you don't already have a JRE (Java Runtime Environment) version 1.5 or newer, download one from Sun's website: [http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp]. Note that the JDK appears above the JRE; you do not need the larger JDK package.

If you have already have a compatible JDK (Java Development Kit) installed, you may skip this step.

== The BNU-Bot installer ==
Download the BNU-Bot installer: [http://bnubot.googlecode.com/files/BNUBot-Install-v5.jar]


= What to do with it =
== Launch the installer ==
Double-click on the JAR. Alternatively, you can type `java -jar BNUBot-Install-v5.jar` from a terminal window.

== Select a location to install BNU-Bot ==
The installer will download all of the required files, and place them in the folder you select. This may be confusing to OSX users, as the installer will create an Application one directory deeper than one might expect.


= Launch the bot! =
== Windows ==
Double-click on BNUBot.exe in the folder where you installed BNU-Bot. For verbose debugging output, use BNUBot-console.exe.

== OSX ==
Double-click on the BNUBot Application.

== Linux ==
Double-click on run.sh, or run `./run.sh` from the console in the directory where you installed BNU-Bot.


= Get support =
== Can I use Starcraft/BroodWar? ==
Yes; Hdx was kind enough to release a solution to get around Warden, but before you do this, please be aware that this solution is not entirely safe. If Blizzard changes the Warden algorithm with the intent to break this workaround, your cdkeys and/or accounts may become banned.

To use this workaround, simply place a copy of Starcraft.exe in your BNU-Bot folder. Please do not advertise this feature without the disclaimer.

== Help with commands ==
There is a wiki page documenting the available commands in BNU-Bot on the wiki: [http://code.google.com/p/bnubot/wiki/Commands]

== Ask questions ==
There is a support form for BNU-Bot on clanbnu.net's forums: [http://forums.clanbnu.net/index.php?board=23.0]

== Report a bug ==

If you are confident that you are reporting a new issue, visit the issue tracker on this website, and file a new issue: [http://code.google.com/p/bnubot/issues/list]. Please include a stack trace, which you can find in log.txt, if applicable. A complete stack trace looks like this:
{{{

In this case, the exception was caused by a missing SWT dependency, which is okay since I was using the Swing GUI (the default).
